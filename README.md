# Python Email Extractor: Project Overview 

- Created a tool that extracts all sender email addresses from a txt file and counts the number of addresses that are extracted 
- Prompts for a file name, opens the file, reads through the file 
- Loops through the file and identifies and parses all sender addresses and ignores all receiver addresses
